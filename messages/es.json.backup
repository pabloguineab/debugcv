There is no time limit.</li><li><strong>Final version (1-2 business days):</strong> I finalize the CV based on your feedback. Unlimited revisions included in Level Up and above.</li></ol_list>",

        "a5": "Absolutely. You have one free round of revisions with the Break Into Tech package, and unlimited revisions for 30 days with Level Up or Power Move.",
        "q6": "Will my new CV be ATS compatible?",
